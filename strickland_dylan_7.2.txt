Assignment 7.2


I'm not sure what is meant by "value of c.constructor". My understanding was that a constructor
is a function for creating a given object, not a variable with a value.

When I run the code:

var Circle = function (r) {
    this.radius = r;
}
Circle.prototype.area = function () {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
}

var c = new Circle(10);

alert(c.constructor.value);

I get a response of "undefined". Is the correct answer 10?

own properties: radius
enumerable properties: none.
